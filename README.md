A 4x4 macropad, with backlit keys and a fully square design.

## Components

The macropad contains 16 keys, each backlit with an SK6812mini-e led. It is controlled by a Seeed XIAO RP2040 microcontroller using either kmk or qmk software.
The switches will be Gateron Milky Yellows as they feel magnificent. On them there will be white keycaps on which I will make vynil stickers for when I decide on the actions that the keys will be doing.

A lot of people on the HackClub Slack have been against my design, and how I have placed the Xiao. I myself think its a great design choice, that won’t interfere with any other component because, in theory with pin headers commonly being 2 mm tall, I should have enough clearance to fit my components on the top and bottom part of the pcb with just enough to spare so that the RP2040 wouldn’t be touching anything.
